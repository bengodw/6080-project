For UI we kept the design simple and visually appealing. Theme is blue and white,
and no other colours are used, save for the secondary (purple) colouring of delete and
unpublish buttons. This was achieved by sticking to the Material UI default theme.
We used consistent fonts and aligned elements on the page is visually pleasing ways, mostly using flexbox. We used headings to emphasise and organise content, but sparingly to avoid
confusion, creating a clear visual hierarchy.

We modelled our UX based on AirBnB - having clickable cards appear of the landing page showing the listings. Interactable elements all have affordances. Buttons are labeled with
their actions, and both buttons and Listing Cards display visual changes when hovered over
or selected. Our App is organised with a responsive Nav Bar that stays in place and offers
easy navigation to important pages. To avoid clutter, certain options like login, register
and logout can be accessed via the profile icon, and page navigation options like All Listings, My Listings, and About can be accessed by a hamburger icon when the screen is
too narrow. Clicking the logo returns the user to the landing page.

Pages are designed with the most important information first. For example the View Listing page is organised hierarchically with import content like the title, address, photo, rating and basic details first.

Finally the App is very responsive to zoom and different screens. We set a max width of the app content so that if viewing on a very wide screen, the information is still close together and highly readable.
