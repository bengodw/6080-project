# 6080-project
My Airbrb project from 6080 (for training lead application)

## Setting up
Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies necessary to run the ReactJS app. Then run `npm start` to start the ReactJS app.

The backend server exists in your individual repository. After you clone this repo, you must run `npm install` in `backend` directory once.

To run the backend server, simply run `npm start` in the `backend` directory. This will start the backend.
