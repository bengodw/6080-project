# 6080-project
My Airbrb project from COMP6080 (for training lead application)
Scored a HD

## Setting up
Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies necessary to run the ReactJS app. Then run `npm start` to start the ReactJS app.

Run `npm install` in `backend` directory once. To run the backend server, simply run `npm start` in the `backend` directory. This will start the backend.
