Focus on perceivability, operability and understandability

PERCEIVABILITY
-Use of descriptive alt text for images.
For example alt="Listing Image" on listing cards and
alt={'listing photo ' + item.id} on listing images which will display as
listing photo 1, listing photo 2, etc.
-Alt text means App is fully if images and icons dont load.
-Text is clearly readable/distinguishable (High contrast, not too small)
-Page does not resist being heavily zoomed in.
-Icons have arial-labels

OPERABILITY
-App can be navigated using only keyboard.
-For example, embedded scrollable segments such 'Your Bookings', 'Reviews' and
Listing 'Photos' were given tabIndex='0' attribute to ensure they can be selected
with tab and scrolled with arrowkeys
-Use of standard HTML tags for forms, lists, etc.
-Use of aria
For example:
Icon only buttons such as the ones in the nav bar have aria labels.
Modals have aria labels
Search uses aria radiogroup

UNDERSTANDABILITY
-UI is designed in a simple and predictable manner
-Button and Link effects are labelled and understandable.
-Forms have labels, for example search filters and add/edit listing
-Added image previews to 'upload thumbnail' and 'upload image' buttons
in add/edit listing so user can see what images they have already uploaded
and avoid confusion.
-Forms specify required inputs with *
